Time Series Light:

Time series light is a time series database fully written in C. it use light weight coroutine to scale which make it possible to handle
thousand of request on system with low-end hardware or embeded applicaiton and it use files as storage for time series data, make it easy to
recover and embed in other application. 

The application it self is under heavly deployement but it is currently does support:
1- Indexing time series data.
2- Reading time series data.
3- Searching metadata for time series names.

Still need to be done:
1- TTL for time series content.
2- Replication (Long term).
3- Configration.
4- More unit testing.
5- Memory leak checks.
6- Performance optimization.
